# **(CS 598) Deep Learning for Healthcare: Final Project**

## **\book Overview of the Project**

### **1. Introduction**

* This repository is the implementation of the final project for **(CS 598) Deep Learning for Healthcare**, Spring 2025 term.

* In this work, we utilized a publicly available [dataset](https://physionet.org/content/dreamt/2.0.0/) related to sleep disorders, introduced in [this study](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlresearch/v248/main/assets/wang24a/wang24a.pdf).

* The citation to the original paper is as follows:
